Today’s society introduces a significant number of smart devices, gadgets as well as online and offline presence that needs to be kept updated to stay connected with new trends. The increased complexity introduced by new technologies and constant availability can take a toll on mental health and strain enjoyment of once personal life. Therefore, simplification is key to process and implement new information effectively into everyday life. So, what are some of the steps that can be taken at home to start the simplification process and what are further benefits you may ask?

#### Gain control of your time

Keeping an organized schedule is key. However, make sure not to overbook yourself by scheduling out your entire day from morning to evening. Simplifying scheduling as in limiting it to only important appointments frees time commitments that can feel consuming and controlling and instead leaves room for unexpected activities and explorations. Furthermore, implement the use of technology to simplify your way to work or your organization at work. Take for example our product [Seats](/products/seats) which focuses on marking occupied seats in a work environment and reserving them, so you don’t have to wonder around as you arrive in the office and wonder if the seat is available. Simple and efficient.

#### Reduce multi-tasking

Handling multiple tasks at once, like being on the phone while writing an email or similar can feel rewarding when completed correctly. However, shifting gears requires a lot of effort from our brain and might even have the opposite effect of efficiency. “In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality” says David Meyer, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. Instead of fulfilling tasks simultaneously, simplify, set one goal after the other and in exchange you will possibility be rewarded with more free time the left at the end of the day.

#### Declutter your house

Limit your possessions as well as limit your risks of spinal cord injuries in case of tripping over objects on the floor or getting hit from falling pieces in a closet above. In order to learn about spinal cord injuries and the possible risks in everyday life have a look at our [NeuroPal](/products/neuropal) product page. Decluttering your space can greatly reduce stress and anxiety and provides your direct access to important appliances that have been thought lost in the one cupboard we store everything we don’t have use for at the moment.

Simplification can range from organizing your home to implementing new technologies to facilitate your everyday life. The benefits include, but are not limited to, increased focus due to less distractions, created room for leisure activities resulting from efficiently handling tasks and the minimization of work overload and stress owing to the reduced multitasking and a clear overview of goals.
