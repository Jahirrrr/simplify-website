In times like this, where everything is different and we often feel we lost the control we had on many aspects of our everyday lives, it’s important to stop, take a deep breath and think, “how do I manage to keep everything under control?”.

When our company was born, no one could image that we would ever face such a crisis like the one we are now living. In a second everything was fine with all members working together and meetings constantly happening everywhere, and all of sudden, everyone has to go home. Our first reaction was just like everyone else’s: “what now?”, but us being [Simplify](http://simplify-lgp.tech/), we knew we had to be the one who would answer this question for everyone.

The key for keeping everything under control is to maintain communication. On our company, we are all practicing social distancing, which means we don’t get to be with each other, however, this does not mean that we don’t communicate. Weekly company meetings with all C-levels, Team-Client meetings, Team meetings, Department meetings, all this and more take place in a normal week of our company. Being close at home contributes for us to be more close with our work and life, but be aware that two heads think better, and faster, than one, and although you might have a hard time in the beginning trying to figure out how all this new technologies work, believe us that at the end of the first week, you’ll be a pro at it.

Something to also keep in mind, real-time communication such as video or phone calls, can be more helpful than a simple direct message or email in a lot of cases. Humans are, by nature, social beings, and while writing and reading can be helpful, a real time conversation where you talk and hear others will not only give you the sense of presence from other humans, that we all miss, but also ensure that all members understand the topic being discussed in the same way. Obviously this is not like a normal face to face conversation, but for the time being, a screen to screen can be the best solution.

Finally, a very important aspect to keep in mind, is keep a good communication with yourself. It’s very easy to loose our sense of balance between work and personal life. Always remember that to produce with quality, you have to be at peace with yourself, and although is ok not to be ok, [Simplify](http://simplify-lgp.tech/) can always help you find a quick, easy and efficient way to solve your everyday life’s struggles, so you can focus on yourself. Because, just like your friends, we are to remind you that everything will be ok!
