Have you ever wondered how manufacturers in the 21st century output *so much* while keeping margins up? Have you ever wondered how they keep quality high even while straining to produce more and more?  

We at Simplify also wondered about that (with a little push from our friends at [INOVA+](https://inova.business/en) ) and that's how our new solution, [Environ](https://simplify-lgp.tech/products/environ), came about. Environ is an innovative industrial monitoring platform which helps businesses really get down to business. 

How do we manage this? One of the great bottlenecks to productivity in manufacturing is being limited by insufficient, poor data, and slow reaction times, whenever something goes wrong in the chain of production. This is where Environ comes in – we bring real-time quality data to the people who need it the most. 

Our platform plugs in to IoT sensors in the field – that is, along the chain of production – and collects useful data on operational status (imagine something like an aquaculture op: you might want to continually monitor temperature, salinity, etc., to keep conditions optimal for your fish). 

This data is transferred using a protocol *specifically* designed for information like this, and kept in a web platform which employees can access (*what* they can access is fully customizable) to keep an eye on things.

This means less mistakes – personnel can act before anything goes wrong – and, where a mistake is inevitable, keeps costs down by letting people know there's a problem to fix right as it happens. 

Best of all: Everything is fully customizable. Environ lets you add and remove users, change what they can see (as above), print out custom reports in a variety of formats, and even add new sensors. This means businesses can tailor the platform to their specific needs with minimal hassle.

​

So just *how* do they do it? Experience helps, but using Environ is a good start.
