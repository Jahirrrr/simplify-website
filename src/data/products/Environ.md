Lack of monitoring and organized information can be the invisible barrier that prevents companies from improving. A good monitoring system can help not only detect areas that need improving, or the reasons why those same areas are in trouble, but also prevent disasters from happening.

With Environ, clients can monitor the environment of their primary activities with IoT sensors through an automated, unobtrusive and easy set-up that also works in low data coverage areas.

This information is available on a online dashboard that provides real-time feedback and allows the creation of customizable reports. All these features help companies have a better understanding of their inner problems and prevent disasters.
