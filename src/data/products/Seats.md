about: A product to optimize the use of space in a Flex Office. The product will achieve this by providing information of the occupancy of seats and meeting rooms in a office, which will make it easier for employees to access these resources and will allow the management to use the information to improve the use of these resources.

---In a Flex Office, employees can sit wherever they want each day. When the employees arrive at the company, they first have to find a seat, which might be difficult and even frustrating in a big company, since they donâ€™t know beforehand which floors have available seats. Depending on the time of the day, open rooms might be mostly full which makes it even harder to find a seat. On top of this, teams can rent a meeting room and end up not using it, while others might need a meeting room and not find one.

To solve these problems and to provide a way for managers to analyse patterns in seating arrangements, with the objective of optimizing the use of space in the office, we propose Seats.
